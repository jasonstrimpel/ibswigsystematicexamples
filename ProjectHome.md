Because I am a nice guy and a public servant to boot I intend in this and subsequent posts to provide enough working documentation to get you up and running with an interface to Interactive Brokers / swigibpy that you can use as a starting point to build an automated trading system in python. This may also be of use to those using IB API in other non swigibpy environments.
